# CPU Load Monitor

The application retrieves load data every 10 seconds.\
The application will show a notification when the load value is at 1 or more for at least 2 minutes.\
The application will show a notification when the load value is recovered (load value under 1 for at least 2 minutes).\
Change the values in `config.ts` to see the data update at a different frequency, or to change the thresholds for notifications.\
(This data should be configrable via the UI in an upcoming version ðŸ˜‰)

The application will retrieve data from the local server at http://localhost:3001. Please run the application "cpu-load" which is shipped along with this FE application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## To do - ie. if this was a production application...

- Add i18n and l10n.
- Add error handling - logging and also displaying to the user.
- The application will not fetch data as often while running in the background. If consistent fetching is needed, implement a solution for this.
- The data in the list should be more granular/detailed - example: how long did the high load last for? how high was it?
- Consider persisting data
- Consider asking the user to allow notifications at a more optimal time (not immediately on page load) - either at a delay after page load, or in response to some action
- Implement CSP

- Better chart display: for example, show label at the minute interval on the x-axis
- Consult with a designer to improve the UI!
